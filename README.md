# GetCounselingAtScc
### Inspiration: 
Students at SCC tend to have to wait till midnight for the school's website to restart, we are going to create a website for users to input their preferred times and book them an appointment without the risk of losing sleep.

# Project DEMO

Working bot, currently it is the end of spring semester so counseling options are on *I think*. Hopefully we get this running for next fall semester for students to utilize.

## Installation:

1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Flask Server Initialization (Terminal 1)
```bash
python backend\server.py
```

3. Run Development Server (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

## TODO:
1. Host Website & FLASK server on Google Cloud
2. Finalize the web bot functions after appointments are updated for next semester
3. Input validations
4. Include time block logic
5. Expand to other community college counseling websites

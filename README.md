# GetCounselingAtScc
Students at SCC tend to have to wait till midnight for the school's website to restart, we are going to create a website for users to input their preferred times and book them an appointment without the risk of losing sleep.

This is with 1 second delay on each action for visibility.

Working bot, currently it is the end of spring semester so counseling options are on *I think*. Hopefully we get this running for next fall semester for students to utilize.


## To Do:

1. Host website 
2. Email API
